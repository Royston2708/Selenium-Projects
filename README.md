# Selenium-Project

This Project Includes a fun little script I came up with using Selenium to register for courses at Columbia. 
At the time I wa required to shortlist and add a bunch of courses to my wish list for priority registration in Fall2020. 
As I had recently moved to the West Coast due to COVID19 I would be 3 hours behinde my peers and hence wanted to avoid the hassle of waking up early, but also wanted to ensure I get to courses I am interested in.
This little code attains my credentials from a file called secrets/credentials and then logs in, searches for course (added in scrolling for a little bit of a human feel) and then registers for them.
